# Grassland Carbon Workshop

*This workshop covers how to measure carbon in grassland ecosystems, including above-ground plant biomass, below-ground plant biomass, and soil carbon. It is organized into four core parts, with an optional fifth part for teams measuring change through time.*

---

## Contents of this workshop

| # | Section | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [**Background**](01_Background/) | Grassland carbon pools, how carbon accumulates, and why roots, shoots, and soils are measured differently. |
| 2 | [**Project Planning**](02_Project_Planning/) | Project goals, study area boundaries, stratification, sample size, sampling locations, and permanent versus single-use plots. |
| 3 | [**Field Methods**](03_Field_Methods/) | Plot setup, vegetation measurements, soil and root coring, depth intervals, root separation, and field notes. |
| 4 | [**Data Interpretation**](04_Data_Interpretation/) | Laboratory results, calculator inputs, carbon stocks, uncertainty, scaling, and reporting. |
| 5 | [**Monitoring Supplement**](05_Monitoring/) *(optional)* | Detecting change through time for restoration, stewardship, and soil-health baselines. |

---

## TLDR: workshop objectives

1. **Understand grassland carbon** above and below ground.
2. **Learn field methods for measuring different carbon pools**, including vegetation plots, soil coring, and root separation.
3. **Turn field and laboratory measurements into carbon stocks and baselines** that can support comparison and monitoring.

---

## How to think about this workshop

For some carbon projects, it helps to begin at the end goal and work backwards. In that spirit, here we start with the spreadsheet that will eventually hold the field and laboratory data:

**[`Grassland_Carbon_Calculator.xlsx`](04_Data_Interpretation/calculators/Grassland_Carbon_Calculator.xlsx)**

Every input should be one of three things:

- documented in the project plan;
- measured or observed in the field; or
- returned by the laboratory under a defined method.

Once the workbook is complete and checked, those inputs can be converted into carbon stocks.

## Brief Background on Canada's grasslands—and what has been lost

A significant proportion of grasslands across Canada have been lost to land conversion, among other drivers. Below, the map shows previous grassland extent in the Prairie provinces, what remains, and the difference. Canada also contains important grasslands, savannahs, parklands, and open ecosystems outside that extent, and loss and restoration opportunities.

**Restoration potential**

Grassland regions have been identified as important opportunities for recovering biodiversity, ecological function, climate resilience, and carbon. Below is the result of a large-scale restoration analysis by WWF-Canada, in which the results highlight the importance of grassland areas in terms of restoration potential to benefit biodiversiry and sequester carbon.

Temperate grassland is among the world's least protected and most converted biomes, and much of Canada's native grassland has been converted or altered. The consequences extend beyond carbon as well, including:

- **Grassland birds** have experienced some of the steepest declines among North American bird groups.
- **Prairie-dependent species**, including swift fox, burrowing owl, greater sage-grouse, and black-footed ferret, are among Canada's species at risk.
- **Deep-rooted perennial cover supports multiple functions**, including water infiltration and storage, erosion control, drought resilience, forage, habitat, and carbon storage.

## What is grassland carbon?

Below we see Native Grassland plant above-ground and below-ground structure (often called the "roots" and the "shoots" of the plants. Notice, native grassland species plant structure includes a vast root network that can extend meters below ground. Compare this to the first plant depicted, which is common lawn grass, the difference between the lawn grass and native grasses are quite stark here.

</p>

Above-ground herbaceous biomass is a measure of the weight of a plant after it have been dried to remove the water of the plant. It can change quickly through growth, senescence, grazing, drought, or fire.

A grassland carbon project must decide which pools it will measure, because soil, roots, shoots, shrubs, and trees respond on different timescales and require different methods.

</td>
<td width="45%">

**A large share of grassland living biomass can occur below ground.** Root amount and root:shoot relationships vary among species, sites, seasons, and management histories.

Roots are important for carbon, but also to building and maintaining the soil structure, water movement, plant recovery, and carbon inputs ([Ecosphere, 2019](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2582)).

## Measuring plant biomass in grasslands

There are two methods to estimate plant biomass:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

<img width="100%" alt="Direct grassland biomass measurement by collecting and weighing plant material" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd32e15b-5702-48d2-96c3-3f0667fd6f34" />

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Method 1 · Direct measurement**

Collect the plant material, dry it in an oven, and weigh it. In this workshop, we show that clipping small vegetation within a small quadrat as the preferred method to accomplish this.

[Part 3 — Field Methods](03_Field_Methods/) covers collection and data requirements here.

<img width="100%" alt="Allometric relationship connecting an easy field measurement to plant biomass" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47ed5e04-5c43-422e-8e39-6921b976d70c" />

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Method 2 · Allometric relationships**

One or multiple measurements of an individual plant are taken, and the relationship of this to its biomass is modelled. Therefore, plant biomass is "estimated" without having to directly remove the plant, as long as one of these relationships is known.


</td>

</table>

Collecting paired measurements can contribute to a local relationship that reduces destructive sampling in later surveys. However, an allometry should only be used when its species or functional group, size range, region, predictor definition, and validation are appropriate for the project.

## Measuring soil organic carbon

The current workshop method is to sample the **full soil profile**, this is from the top of the soil, beggining a the surface and extending down to the parent material or refusal (which is as far deep as you can go).

There are 2 main methods we will show to collect soil samples, these are "Soil Pits" shown in a) and "Soil Cores" shown in d), e), and f)
