"""Shared style and reference data for Grassland_Carbon_Calculator.xlsx.

Forked from Wetlands/_source/wet_style.py. The one structural addition is
ORANGE -- "NEEDS YOUR INPUT" -- a fourth colour in the key for values the
workshop cannot supply and must not invent. Every orange cell carries a
working default so the workbook computes end to end from the moment it is
opened, and a QC advisory that fires while the default is still in place.
